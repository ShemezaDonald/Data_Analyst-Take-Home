Subject: Data Quality Issues and Key Findings from Initial Exploration


Hi Product Manager,


I have completed an initial exploration of the dataset and identified a few key points and potential issues:

I. Key Data Quality Issues:

    1. Duplicate and Logical Errors:

	  - 25,560 duplicate RECEIPT_IDs (over 50% of records) suggest potential data quality issues or application misuse.
	  - 94 records show SCAN_DATE occurring before PURCHASE_DATE, indicating data entry errors.

     2. Missing and Inconsistent Values:

           Key columns like STATE, LANGUAGE, GENDER, CATEGORY_1, MANUFACTURER, and BRAND contain missing (NaN) values, impacting user segmentation and product analysis.


Observation: The high number of duplicate RECEIPT_IDs constitutes a significant portion of the total dataset. This anomaly requires further investigation to determine if it is:
		- An expected behavior in the app, such as resubmission of receipts by users,
		- A potential data quality issue resulting from data processing errors,
		- Or an indicator of potential abuse or fraudulent activity.

II. Interesting Trend:

           From my preliminary analysis, Millennials contribute the highest percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category at 43.06%, followed by Baby Boomers at 40.94%, and Gen X at 32.98%. The Silent Generation showed no contribution in this category.


III. Request for Action:
         
	     On the duplicate RECEIPT_IDs issue, it would be helpful to:

		- Clarify expected app behavior: Obtain insights from the product teams regarding how receipts are processed and whether duplicate RECEIPT_IDs are typical.
		- Review data processing pipelines: Verify if there are any known data ingestion or duplication issues in the current data workflow.

	     Understanding these aspects will allow us to assess the validity of the data and take appropriate measures to clean and prepare the data for more accurate analysis.



Best,
Aymar Donald
